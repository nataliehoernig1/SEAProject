<h1>Structured External Assignment: Security Initiative</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This was the final project I completed for my Web & Data Security Course. We were required to come up with a security initiative for a global e-commerce company that is acquiring another company within the next few months. The project consisted of coming up with a name for the company, adapting the SANS Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) template to fit with the companies needs and requirements, and an 8-page paper detailing your strategy for the initiative and recommendations for various tools for the company to use such as network auditing tools, IDS/IPS, vulnerability scanners, etc.
